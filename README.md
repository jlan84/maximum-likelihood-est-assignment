# Exploring Maximum Likelihood

In this exercise we're going to explore the concept of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).

Maximum likelihood estimation is the gold standard methodology for estimating some true parameter from a data set.  For example:

  - We have a coin of unknown fairness, and we want to flip the coin a bunch of times and use the results to figure out the fairness of the coin.
  - We have a chunk of matter that is undergoing radioactive decay (the atoms in the material spontaneously self-destruct at some rate), and we would like to figure out the rate of decay.

  Some students struggle to generalize the canonical examples of coin flips and radioactive decay into there day to day, so we'll stretch our legs a bit by working with some real world data.
